# My RPG

Welcome to my RPG project. As a group, we had to develop a functional and visualy appealing RPG game during our first year at Epitech.  
While the project is relatively short in duration, we focused on delivering a polished and enjoyable gaming experience that showcases our skills and creativity.
## Project Details

- **Binary Name :** my_rpg
- **Language :** C
- **Graphic Library :** CSFML
## Game Overview

In this RPG, our goal was to create a functional game using CSFML in a short period of time.  
We were kinda free on the theme so we decided to create a 'The Legend of Zelda' RPG look-a-like.  
## How to run the game

Firstly you will need to install CSFML on your device.  
On Linux you can use a package manager but depending on your distro it might be a bit tricky.

To run the game, follow these steps:  

    1. Clone the repository to your local machine :
    ```console
    git clone git@github.com:Abussos10/my_RPG.git
    ```
    2. Ensure that you have a C compiler installed.
    3. Compile the source files using make
    4. Execute the compiled binary file to start the game.
    5. Enjoy playing the RPG!
