# My RPG

Welcome to my RPG project. As a group, we had to develop a functional and visualy appealing RPG game during our first year at Epitech.  
While the project is relatively short in duration, we focused on delivering a polished and enjoyable gaming experience that showcases our skills and creativity.
## Project Details

- **Binary Name :** my_rpg
- **Language :** C
- **Graphic Library :** CSFML
## Game Overview

In this RPG, our goal was to create a functional game using CSFML in a short period of time.  
We were kinda free on the theme so we decided to create a 'The Legend of Zelda' RPG look-a-like.  
## How to run the game

Firstly you will need to install CSFML on your device.  
On Linux you can use a package manager but depending on your distro it might be a bit tricky. (*If you are on Ubuntu use the script in csfml_installation folder it's working fine*)

Official documentation : 
https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/csfml/index.php

To run the game, follow these steps:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**1.**&nbsp;&nbsp;   Clone the repository to your local machine :  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```
    git clone git@github.com:Abussos10/my_RPG.git  
    ```  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**2.** Ensure that you have a C compiler installed.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**3.** Compile the source files using  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```
    make 
    ```  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**4.** Execute the compiled binary file to start the game.  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```
    ./my_rpg
    ```  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**5.** Enjoy playing the RPG !

## Conclusion

We, as a team of three, consisting of two developers and a graphic designer, have worked on this project. Although our RPG project is relatively short in duration, we are proud of the functional and visually appealing game we have created. 

Given more time, we would have loved to expand and enhance this project further. However, due to other project commitments, we had to focus on delivering a polished experience within the given timeframe. 

Thanks to [XP3Kaiser](https://github.com/XP3Kaiser) and [Golg0th](https://github.com/Golg0th) for their invaluable contributions. Without their involvement, this project would not have been possible.
